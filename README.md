Karl Schultz's submission for Week 12 challenge of University of Oregon Data Analytics Bootcamp. Before running this jupyter file you need to create the database 'uk_food' with collection 'establishments' and fill the collection with 'establishments.json' file. To do this, type mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json into the mongoimport terminal. Alternately you could also open MongoDBCompass and create new database 'uk_food' with collections 'establishments'. Then fill empty 'establishments' collection with data from 'establishments.json file'.
